    <p>“Hey Sofia, check this out.” Stephen called from a patch of ground at the far end of the landing strip. “This is
        really weird.”</p>

    <p>“What’s up?” Sofia jogged over to take a look.</p>

    <p>“It’s some kind of tiny pyramid I think. I tried picking it up, but it was stuck.”</p>

    <p>“Well, maybe it’s not actually so tiny! Maybe it’s HUGE!”</p>

    <p>“Hmm, well maybe we could dig it up?”</p>

    <p>“Stephen! Is that the spirit of adventure I finally sense in you?”</p>

    <p>“M-maybe. Anyway, I can probably have it dug up in a bit. Let’s see how far this thing goes down.”</p>

    <p>After half a day, Nikola finally steps away from the ships engine room having done all the work he can in the
        remaining daylight. “Sofiaaaaaa, Steeephennnn? Where are you guys?” He called out, cupping his hands around his
        mouth to boost his volume.</p>

    <p>“Over here!” He hears Sofia call out from the far end of the landing strip. Nikola walks towards her voice and
        comes upon a big pit in the ground, at the center of which he sees Sofia and Stephen standing in front of a
        large pyramid.</p>

    <p>“Holy CAT-5 that thing is massive! Why didn’t we see it on the way down?” he asked the two.

    <p>“I just dug it-” Stephen started.</p>

    <p>“WE just dug it up!” Sofia interrupted. “Come on down Nikola, we could use your help figuring out this diagram
        next to the door.”</p>
    Nikola hopped over the edge of the pit and slid down the side. “Okay, let me take a look at it...”</p>
</div>

<p>The robots have discovered an ancient pyramid. All the points on the interior of the triangle
    are marked by numbers. Various combinations of numbers and switches were written by the door in the form of
    geometric shapes.</p>

<p>Consider the points on an infinite grid of equilateral triangles as shown below:</p>

<p class="for_info_only"><img src="{{ MEDIA }}numbers-triangle.png"
                              width="400px"/></p>
<p class="for_editor_only"><img src="{{ MEDIA }}numbers-triangle.png"
                                width="200px"/></p>


<p>Note that if we number the points from left to right and from top to bottom, then groups of these points form the
    vertices of certain geometric shapes. For example, the list of points [1,2,3] and [7,9,18] are the vertices of
    triangles, the sets [11,13,26,24] and [2, 3, 5, 4] are the vertices of parallelograms (lozenge), and the sets
    [4,5,9,13,12,7] and [4,6,15,26,24,11] are the vertices of regular hexagons.</p>

                              width="600px"/></p>
<p class="for_editor_only"><img src="{{ MEDIA }}triangles-examples.png"
                                width="380px"/></p>

<p>Write a program which will continuously accept a set of points on this triangular grid, analyze it, and determine
    whether the points are the vertices of an "acceptable" figure: triangle, parallelogram (lozenge), or a hexagon. In
    order for a figure to be acceptable, it must meet the following three conditions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>1) Each side of the figure must coincide with an edge on the grid.</li>
    <li>2) All sides of the figure must be the same length.</li>
    <li>3) The figure must be convex (has a regular shape).</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>Your program should deduce which geometric figure is represented from the number of points within your input set
    (e.g., six points can only represent a hexagon, etc). </p>

<p><span><b>Input:</b> A list of no more than six points. The points are limited to a range of 1 through 32767.</span>
</p>

<p><b>Output:</b> An integer: 3 for a triangle, 4 for a parallelogram, 6 for a regular hexagon and 0 if the figure is
    not acceptable. The listed points may be given in any order.</p>
